Summary of Last Week

I changed several registers and instructions in the bang bang program, and obtained the following results

Register values
change_values.gdb:
change starting value → similar effect to last week
change_random_values.gdb → values not associated with variables had no effect on the system
change_reg_addr.gdb → no effect on the system
stuck_at.gdb → no effect on the system

Instructions
change_branch.gdb → change bne to je → changes behavior for half of system
change_jump.gdb → change jmp to je and jg → no effect
change_sub.gdb → got SEGFAULTe
change_sub_gen.gdb → got SEGFAULT
change_jne.gdb → min goes down to 64 and max to 74

From this, we can conclude that the most sensitive registers concern the variables that we set and the most sensitive instructions are ones where we change the subtract to add.

Goals for Next Week

Test added macros
Run tests in large numbers
