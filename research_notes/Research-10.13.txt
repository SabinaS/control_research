Research- 10/13Previous Week SummaryI researched Dyninst but wasn’t able to get it to successfully do what I wanted. Then I thought about just using a hex editor to rewrite one bit in the file. Using an online hex editor (hexed.it), I changed various bits throughout the file:ChangeFileEffectLast bit in the file BangBangController.javaBangBangController_lastbit.javaProgram does not compileFirst bit in the file BangBangController.javaBangBangController_firstbit.javaProgram did not compileHowever, after these trails, I came to the realization that changing any bits in the source files would likely result in the program not being able to compile. Goals for Next WeekCreate a more concrete analysis of ways to game the algorithm. Test those methods to produce results. 10/13 Agenda1. Review revised Bang Bang Algorithm2. Review methods for trying to break the algorithm
