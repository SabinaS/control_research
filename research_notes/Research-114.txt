Research- 11/4

Rewrote Java files as C files
- instead of classes, wrote program as a series of functions with global variables
- since C doesn’t support boolean type, converted all boolean variables to int where a 0 is false and a 1 is true

Updates: 
- simulation stops after 5 trials and reaches perfect temp twice…
- sim now runs 100 trials but always with same results and skips certain runtimes
- simulation now runs fine
- makefile compiles fine but to run with debug option, compiled instead using:
   gcc –g –o bang_bang_controller bang_bang_controller.c

Now will make a simple hello world program to test the gdb macros
