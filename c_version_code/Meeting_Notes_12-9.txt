Finsih writing and polishing the genfaults script by Monday
Meet on Monday during our regular meeting time

It's better to be able to run the python script from the terminal
	and call gdb from within the python script so don't have the dependency
	of needing gdb to extend python software and can run it anywhere

Create a final report detailing everything I have done and researched this semester,
	along with the genfaults script and the results from running that
	
Complete and send the report by 4pm on Dec 24th so Simha can give me a grade
